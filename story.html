             <h2> Kanashiko’s story</h2>
            <p>Like most people kana received her first katachi at the age of 11, however unlike most people she did not find her purpose.
                she tried a bit of everything, she went to talks from professionals in different fields, she tried music and arts of all kinds, tried the scientific fields but nothing stuck. 
                It's not that she did not like these things…but she found that she did not want to do just one thing for the rest of her life and thus kana was designated a Searcher, 
                someone with no purpose and thus no value…now a young adult and almost done with school kana finds a hidden truth.
            </p>

            <h2> Imi's story</h2>
            <p>Imi can be a bit of a hothead; she is very confident in her skills to find purposes for humans.
                While she is one of the youngest katachi in the agency, her official job title is henka.
                As a henka Imi’s job is to help humans find their purpose or path in life.All of her clients find theirs after three tries; as such, 
                she has been recognized as the best and thinks she knows best. However, she just had it easy because kids are easy to deal with, as kids are very impressionable and mailable.
                Over the course of the story, she needs to learn that she doesn't have all the answers and that she needs to work with her clients and not against them. 
            </p>
