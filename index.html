                Throughout my time at Indiana University of Indianapolis, I have always had a strong interest in the Japanese language and culture. At first, I had only planned to complete the minor in Japanese studies, but as I completed my core work, 
                I realized that I was not satisfied; I wanted to do more. 
                This feeling only increased after my time in the study abroad class, where we learned more about Japanese history during WWII and how the atomic bombs affected life then and now.
                When I came back to the US, I decided that I had to do something, be it share my experience and thoughts or provide a platform for my classmates to do the same. 
                Even now, I still feel the need to do something, as I feel like I haven't done enough. Thus, in this paper, I will outline a proposal for a project that represents my desire to promote peace in my own way, so that the atrocities committed on August 6th and 9th don't happen again. 
                Through this project, I aim to convey the preciousness and fragility of life. And convey the work that must be done to protect it.
                This project is composed of three major projects; the first is a website that I will code, detailing the progress made on the other two parts of the project. 
                This way, people can see the process that went into creating the final product. 
                The second is a short animatic that explains the theme of the project as a whole, and finally, a game, which will be a short game in which the player must take care of a bonsai tree to the best of their ability and keep it alive for a ‘week’ in the game. 
                All three of these components are tied together by a story written by me.  
                Feel Free to look around the site, you are also weclome to demo the game here:

            </div>
            <p>In this world, much like our own, there are magical creatures called katachi.
                Most don't know where they came from, some say they are gods, others think they are Spirits. 
                What they are doesn't really matter, not to humans anyway.
                What does matter is what they do, they give you purpose. 
                Here in this world that is everything, your worth, your value, all of it tied to your purpose.
                Some are born with the purpose to protect, others to create, others to nurture, others destroy…this directly leads to what you can do for society…be it good or bad a katachi will help you find what that thing is. 
                Most are assigned a katachi at the age of 11, most discover their purpose at the age of 18…
                it's rare for someone to choose a profession outside of their purpose but when it dose happen a katachi will help them find the right fit for said pourpus, for example if you are a protector, but don't like violence you would not become a police officer you would be a firefighter.
