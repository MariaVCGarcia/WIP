             <h2> Kanashiko’s story</h2>
            <p>Like most people kana received her first katachi at the age of 11, however unlike most people she did not find her purpose.
                she tried a bit of everything, she went to talks from professionals in different fields, she tried music and arts of all kinds, tried the scientific fields but nothing stuck. 
                It's not that she did not like these things…but she found that she did not want to do just one thing for the rest of her life and thus kana was designated a Searcher, 
                someone with no purpose and thus no value…now a young adult and almost done with school kana finds a hidden truth.
