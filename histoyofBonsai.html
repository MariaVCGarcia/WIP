                The art of bonsai has a rich history in Japan. Actually it originated in China as the art of making mini forests. It has its origins in Chinese religious practices; they believed that by recreating small parts of nature they could more effectively tap into the magical properties of that element, it then spread to Japan about twelve hundred years ago. It was most popular in Zen Buddhism. And was initially practiced by the zen monks. It quickly grew from there and was practiced by many people of all social classes throughout the country for the shogun to the peasants. 
                But what is a Bonsai tree and how do we raise one? That's a wonderful question: 
                A bon-sai tree is just a small miniature tree that is grown with great care and is shaped throughout the tree's life. Basically it is living art. Most practitioners of the art form say that raising bonsai trees helps them feel more in tune with nature. That they must be very intentional with how they raise the tree and pay attention to all the small things it does in order for it to grow in the way the person likes. 
	            The first stage of the process is of course the seed or sapling, this is the fun part raising a bonsai tree takes many many years, decades even. It's best to apply the wire to the tree once it has grown into a daily healthy sapling, of course for the first year it's best to leave it alone, but once it is established we can wire it and apply its shape. 
	            The early development stage of the tree, this is where most hobbyist are, the main things to keep in mind are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Potting the tree in a bonsai container and establishing a domesticated root ball</li>
                <li>Define the trunkline from base to tip</li>
                <li>Thicken the trunk</li>
                <li>Develop the 'bones' of the bonsai by growing interesting primary branches</li>
                <li>large wounds</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Then we have the secondary features of the tree these are: </p>
               <ul>
                <li>Continuing the cultivation of a well-ramified root ball</li>
                <li>Growing secondary branches</li>
                <li>Thickening of any primary branches that may still be in early development</li>
                <li>Continued healing of wounds</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And finally the refinement stage:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Continue cultivating and maintaining a healthy root ball</li>
                <li>Balancing foliage growth across the tree</li>
                <li>Maintaining the shape and style of the tree</li>
              </ul>
